# Ocean-trends-analysis
Analysis of ocean temperature, salinity, oxygen, and chlorophyll trends from 2000–2025 using Python visualization
# Oceanic Trends and Environmental Implications

## Overview
This project analyzes long-term oceanic data from 2000 to 2025, focusing on temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, and chlorophyll concentration. Using Python-based visualizations, it reveals environmental shifts and explores ethical considerations in data transformation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Key Features
- Moving average graphs for temperature and salinity trends
- Correlation heatmaps and scatter plots
- Chlorophyll distribution mapping
- Ethical reflection on data transformation risks

## Results
- Rising ocean temperatures and salinity over time
- Positive correlation between salinity and dissolved oxygen
- Shifts in chlorophyll concentration suggest ecosystem changes
- Emphasized transparency and validation in environmental data analysis
